# Libre-TV

An attempt to build an open Smart TV system, providing the means and documentation required to compile it yourself. 
As I am an 18 year-year-old education major (with an interest and passion for Computer Science, Engineering, and 
technology), it will not be possible for me to build a TV or remote, nor can I program and test an OS environment.
